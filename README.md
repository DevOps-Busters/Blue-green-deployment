# 📘 **Understanding Blue-Green Deployment & Implementation**

## 🔵🟢 **Blue-Green Deployment**

**Blue-Green Deployment** is a **zero-downtime deployment strategy** that involves two identical environments (**Blue** and **Green**). One environment serves live traffic while the other stays on standby. When deploying a new version, traffic is switched to the new environment seamlessly.

### **🔹 How it Works?**
1. **Two Environments (Blue & Green):** Identical production environments.
2. **Live Traffic on One Environment:** Users interact with only one (e.g., Blue).
3. **Deploy & Test in Standby Environment:** New version is deployed in the standby environment (e.g., Green).
4. **Traffic Switch:** If the new version is stable, traffic is switched from Blue to Green.
5. **Rollback (If needed):** If issues arise, traffic is switched back to Blue.

### **🎯 Benefits of Blue-Green Deployment:**
✅ **Zero Downtime:** No interruptions during updates.  
✅ **Quick Rollbacks:** Instantly switch back in case of failures.  
✅ **Better Testing:** New version can be tested in production-like environment before release.

## 📌 **What We Are Doing in This Project?**

In this project, we are implementing **Blue-Green Deployment** using **Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and GitHub Actions** to achieve seamless deployments with no downtime.

### **🚀 Our Deployment Strategy:**
- The **Blue environment** serves live traffic initially.
- We deploy an updated version to the **Green environment**.
- Once verified, traffic is switched to the **Green environment**.
- If issues arise, we rollback by switching traffic back to **Blue**.

### **💡 Key Technologies Used:**
- **Node.js** → Web application running on Express.js.
- **Docker** → Containerizes the application.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** → Manages deployment.
- **Helm** → Simplifies Kubernetes deployments.
- **GitHub Actions** → Automates CI/CD pipeline.

## 🏗️ **Implementation Overview**

1. **Application Code**
   - A simple **Node.js Express app** displays whether Blue or Green is active.
   - **Feature toggles** allow enabling/disabling new features dynamically.

2. **Dockerization**
   - The application is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Two separate deployments for **Blue** and **Green** versions.
   - Kubernetes manages the switching of environments.

4. **Helm Integration**
   - Helm templates automate Kubernetes deployment.

5. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**
   - Automates **building, pushing, and deploying** new versions using Docker and Helm.
